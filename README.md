## Personal blog

This is my personal blog where I post articles and resources I create to teach programming for beginners. Some of these were created to help students in the programming courses where I'm an instructor at [UNNOBA](http://www.unnoba.edu.ar/) university. For that reason, most of the blog contents are in Spanish.
